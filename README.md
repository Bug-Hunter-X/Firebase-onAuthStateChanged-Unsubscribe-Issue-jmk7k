This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's onAuthStateChanged function: improper unsubscription.  The `authBug.js` file shows the faulty code, where the unsubscribe function is not always called leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The solution, provided in `authBugSolution.js`, demonstrates the correct way to handle unsubscription within a component's lifecycle to prevent these issues.
